Proposal:
  Space Invaders
  Station: 94
    VGA graphics
    Game loop on timer
    ps/2 keyboard control
    Score on 7 segs
    Sound effects through audio codec (maybe)

Tasks:
  Drawing code
    ships, enemies, bullets, barriers
    functions to draw bitmap/letters/shapes

  Keyboard
    interrupts for input
    read the input and save keyboard state
    player input (left, right, space/fire)
    game state input (reset)

  Timer
    run game loop at 60fps

  Game loop
    Enemy movement
    Player moment
    Bullet creation/movement
    Collision detection destroys bullets/enemies, loselife, damage barrier

  Game data
    Score
    Lives
    Enemies left
    State of barriers

  7seg
    Display score, lives

Breakdown:
  Lab 2
    Drawing
    Keyboard interrupts
    Timer interrupts

  Lab 3
    Player movement
      x
      
    Enemy movement
      Enemy direction
      Array of enemies (x, y, alive)
    Bullet firing

  Lab 4
    Collision
    Keep track of score, lives
    Restart game
